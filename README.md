### Project summary:
Classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset has been preprocessed (image normalization; one-hot encoding) and trained via a convolutional neural network (including max pooling, a fully connected layer, and dropout) on all the samples.
